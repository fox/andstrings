andstrings
==========

`andstrings` extracts strings from Android project into a localizable strings.xml file - similar to `genstrings` tool for the iOS. Also replaces any hardcoded strings with an appropriate reference to a localized string.

This is a work in progress. Currently parses just the layouts xml files. Output is placed into a "andstrings" folder.
